Baby steps as I teach myself the choreography of React Native. Starting with a to do list.

## Usage
To run this application, you will either need to set up an emulator, or have the Expo client downloaded on your phone. The Expo application can be found on the Google and Apple store respectively.


Once the above has been done, install npm dependencies first -

`npm i`

Then start the development server -

`yarn start`

Finally, open the Expo client on your phone and scan the QR code provided to you. Enjoy!
